*A game library extension for* ***[EmulatorJS]***

<br>

This add - on site allows users of EmulatorJS to manage ROMs, including a built-in (albeit basic) data and image scraper.<br>

PSX has returned!
<br>

## Installation

This is a drag and drop extension, with the <br>
exception that it requires something to host <br>
PHP files like XAMPP. After that, simply upload your roms.<br>
Bulk rom uploading has been added to make this easier.

I've taken out image scraping for now, I will try to add it in with more options etc with the rebuild.<br>
Instead, I've given cloud save options!

## BIOS setup

To add BIOs for the systems that require it, simply<br />
add the BIOs to a ZIP file and rename it to *console name*.zip.<br />
For example, the gba bios would be kept as /bios/gba.zip <br />
